## A Fibonacci sequence 
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as a set of numbers that starts with a 1 or a 0, followed by a 1, and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. 
If the Fibonacci sequence is denoted F (n), where n is the first term in the sequence, the following equation obtains for n = 0, where the first two terms are defined as 0 and 1 by convention:
```
The first ten numbers in Fibonacci sequence is:

F (0) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

In some texts, it is customary to use n = 1. 
In that case, the first two terms are defined as 1 and 1 by default, and therefore:

F (1) = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...
```
